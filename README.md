Uses `thingmatron` REST backend.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies - use ci build to get locked dependencies.
# This project is so old that npm install newer deps will break it.
npm ci

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
